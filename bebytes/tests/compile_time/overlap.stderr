  = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is in scope
  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `BeBytes` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: the following trait is implemented but not in scope; perhaps add a `use` for it:

1 + use std::fmt::Write;
